    "This test is designed to test the resample step in the calwebb_image3 pipeline. At the end of the calwebb_image3 pipeline, the set of files defined in an association table will be distortion corrected and combined. Resample is the step that applies the distortion correction using the drizzling algorithm (as defined in the DrizzlePac handbook) and combines the listed files. For more information on the pipeline step visit the links below. \n",

    "\n",
    "This test is performed by creating a set of simulated data with multiple point sources located at specified coordinates. The simulator puts in the expected distortion, so the initial output data comes out of the simulator in distorted coordinates. When this data is then run through calwebb_detector1, calwebb_image2 and calwebbb_image3, the combined, undistorted image should have the point sources registered at the expected locations. In flight, this test can be repeated with known stars that should be found at their expected coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create the data for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of data used in this particular test were created with the MIRI Data Simulator (MIRISim). Referring to the MIRISim link, you can see how to set up and run the simulator to re-create the input files if you wish. The data was run with a scene.ini file that specified what the scene should look like, with coordinates for the stars given in units of arcsecond offsets from the center of the field of view. The scene.ini file as well as the setup files simuation.ini and simulator.ini are needed to run the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in the mirisim conda environment, the simulation is run with the command line:\n",
    "> mirisim simulation.ini\n",

    "The simulator created four files, two exposures each at two different dither positions, using the specified filter. Make sure the WCSAXES header keyword in the SCI extension is set to 2 and not 4. If it is set to 4, change it to 2.\n",

    "The four files were then run individually through the calwebb_detector1 and calwebb_image2 pipelines. When running the calwebb_detector1 pipeline, increase the threshold for a detection in the jump step from 4 sigma to 10 sigma to avoid a current issue where the jump detection step flags a large percentage of pixels as jumps. This can be done on the command line. (commands to be typed start with $)\n",
