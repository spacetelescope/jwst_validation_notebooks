This test also takes in a set of four simulated background images, at four dithered positions, with around 40 fainter stars across the field of view and Lyot mask. All images will be processed through calwebb_detector1, and put into an association file to be run through calwebb_image2. This will tell the background step which are the science observations and which are the background observations so that it will do a sigma clipped mean of the background exposures, then subtract the mean from each of the science observations.\n",
