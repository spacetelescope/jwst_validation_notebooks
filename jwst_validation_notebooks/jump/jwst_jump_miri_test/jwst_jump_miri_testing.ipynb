    "This test is designed to test the jump step in the calwebb_detector1 pipeline. This is the step that checks for outliers in each individual ramp and flags jumps (cosmic rays or other anomalies). For more information on the pipeline step visit the links below. \n",

    "The data for this test was taken as part of ground testing. The file was originally named MIRM107-E-6021041029_1_493_SE_2016-01-21T04h22m18.fits and is an Imaging file from test IMG-RAD-17 with a point source centered at pixel (702,452) with a slope value of around 300 DN/s. It consists of 5 integrations of 20 frames each. The file was processed into a format compatible with the pipeline using a script called create_data and renamed to jw04192001001_01101_00001_MIRIMAGE_uncal.fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two simulated data files used in the testing. In Build 7.8, the jump step was extended so that data files with 3 and 4 groups per integration will be flagged for jumps rather than skipping the jump step. Two data files meeting these criteria were created for this test.\n",

    "This test is performed by taking the uncal file which was the output of the script create_data, adding known cosmic ray jumps of varying strength at specified pixels and running it through the calibration pipeline to see if the pixels are flagged as jumps. The pipeline flags the four neighboring pixels of a jump detection if the jump is high enough (10 sigma?). It then checks to see if the single pixel cosmic ray was detected, and whether the neighboring pixels were also flagged.\n",

We should also use a different saturation file to make sure saturation is handled correctly (while waiting for an update to the reference file in CRDS).\n",
